# Link-in-Bio Platform Todo List

## Current Issues to Fix ðŸš¨

- [ ] Fix step detection logic - user saves on step 2 but edit resumes at step 3
- [ ] Fix image persistence issue - image disappears on subsequent saves

## Plan for Bug Fixes

### Issue 1: Wrong Step Detection
**Problem**: When user saves draft on step 2, editing resumes at step 3
**Root Cause**: `detectStartStep()` function determines step based on data presence, not where user actually saved
**Solution**: Add `currentStep` field to database to track where user saved from

### Issue 2: Image Disappears
**Problem**: Image disappears on subsequent saves while other data persists
**Root Cause**: `handleSaveDraft()` only uploads new image if `imageFile` exists, doesn't preserve existing `imageUrl`
**Solution**: Preserve existing `imageUrl` when no new image is selected

### Implementation Steps:
1. Update database schema to add `currentStep` field to Product model
2. Modify save draft functions to store current step
3. Update step detection to use stored step instead of data analysis
4. Fix image persistence by preserving existing imageUrl
5. Test both scenarios thoroughly
